// This is a utility class that makes it easier to work with asynchronous tasks.
// Here's why I don't just use Promises:
// (a) I don't want to depend on a Promise implementation.
// (b) Promises aren't cancellable (yet?), and I want cancellability.
//
// This is very stripped down, compared to Promises.
// (a) You can only call .thenDo() once.
// (b) Tasks always complete with a pair (err, result).
// (c) Regardless of errors or cancellation, the argument of .thenDo() is
//     *always* executed, and asynchronously.
// (d) The argument to .thenDo() must return either undefined or a Task. I don't
//     promote values to Tasks, like what happens with Promises.

 * when the task is finished, to report its result. The callback should be given
 * two parameters (err, result). One of err and result should be null/undefined,

 *
 * The `doSomething` function can optionally return a cancel function. This will
